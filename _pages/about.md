<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I obtained my PhD degree this summer, and now I am an assistant researcher in OceanBase, Ant Group.

I am actively finding interesting problems in research and trying to learn some lessons from them! So, please contact me if any collaboration is possible!

Thanks to my supervisor [``Jian Liu``](https://jianliu.phd) and prior collaborators in the past five years. They help me understand some techniques in encrypted databases including order-preserving encryption, oblivious algorithms, functional encryption, and homomorphic encryption.

In all listed publications below, I am the first author/corresponding author/co-first author.
